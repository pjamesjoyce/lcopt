        Lcopt is a python module for creating fully parameterised LCA foreground models using a Flask based interactive GUI developed by [James Joyce](https://pjamesjoyce.github.io/)
        It integrates with SimaPro and BrightWay2
        
        Online documentation, including full installation instructions, is available [here](http://lcopt.readthedocs.io)
